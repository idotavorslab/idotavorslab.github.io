	"our lab": "We focus on exploring the connection between brain structure, function and human behavior, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigate what underlies behavioral and functional differences between individuals, such as changes in functional and structural connectivity and differences in the brain’s microstructure. In addition, we study learning-related brain plasticity by developing behavioral tasks that induce functional and structural brain modifications. For our work, we use advanced mathematical and statistical analysis methods.",

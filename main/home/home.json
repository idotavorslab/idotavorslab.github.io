		"We investigate what underlies behavioral and functional differences between individuals, such as changes in functional and structural connectivity and differences in the brain’s microstructure.",
		"In addition, we study learning-related brain plasticity by developing behavioral tasks that induce functional and structural brain modifications. For our work, we use advanced mathematical and statistical analysis methods."

For our work, we use advanced mathematical and statistical analysis methods.</p>",

We found changes in diffusion properties in motor system regions such as the premotor cortex and cerebellum, providing an important reminder for the dynamic nature of the human brain and for the potential of diffusion MRI to follow on tissue plasticity over short timescales.</p>",

He completed his Ph.D. in Neurobiology under the guidance of Prof. Yaniv Assaf studying rapid learning-related structural plasticity in the living human brain. He then proceeded to a postdoctoral fellowship at the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) at the University of Oxford. There, working with Prof. Saad Jbabdi he studied individual variability in brain function and connectivity. In 2017, Ido joined Tel Aviv University as a senior lecturer at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Sagol School of Neuroscience.",

She completed two Ph.D. dissertations at Tel Aviv University: her Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience (psychology department) focused on the role of consciousness and attention in processing contextual violations, under the guidance of Prof. Dominique Lamy and Prof. Leon Deouell from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her Ph.D. in philosophy was a descriptive-deconstructive analysis of the mind-body problem in neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. Marcelo Dascal. She then continued to a postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. There, she worked in the lab of Prof. Christof Koch in the division of biology, and in the lab of Prof. Ralph Adolphs in the division of humanities and social sciences. In 2015, she began her appointment as a faculty member in Tel Aviv University’s school of psychological science and the Sagol school of neuroscience.",

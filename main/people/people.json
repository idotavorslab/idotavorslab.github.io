He completed his Ph.D. in Neurobiology under the guidance of Prof. Yaniv Assaf studying rapid learning-related structural plasticity in the living human brain. He then proceeded to a postdoctoral fellowship at the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) at the University of Oxford. There, working with Prof. Saad Jbabdi he studied individual variability in brain function and connectivity. In 2017, Ido joined Tel Aviv University as a senior lecturer at the Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Sagol School of Neuroscience.",
